# VPC-for-Production-Environment
Building a Resilient and secure VPC for Production Environment:
This project shows how to build a highly Available and Secure Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) architecture to
host production servers. The VPC is built for redundancy and fault tolerance, including multiple availability
zones, Auto Scaling group, Application Load Balancers, and NAT Gateways. The servers are installed on
private subnets, which provide increased security while still allowing internet access via NAT Gateways
